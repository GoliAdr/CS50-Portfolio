"If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?"
1) The average of 3 random values does not tell anything about the audio aura from the user and 100 songs are way too less for that too.
It depends how often the user hears the song too andI do not really know how a song can be calculated in energy or danceability
I think it is way too oversimplified because with this values the only thing you can say is "The user listens to music".


"Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?"

2) Genres have always different energys so melancholic music can have a lot of energy but could be calculated with a low energy or Danceability Value.
You should considere the genre too and how often this song was listened too.
Was it a 2 week phase were the user listend to the song or did the user here it the whole year in different time periods.
There could be a few extreme songs that could distort the values
